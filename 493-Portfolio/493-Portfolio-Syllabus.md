## Structure
This course will follow lecture / lab / critique format. Lecture will consist of discussion, demonstration, case studies, and appropriate examples. Critique evaluations will happen on a daily basis. Participation in critiques is mandatory. Attendance and participation will be noted and count toward your final grade.

Students are expected to work in class during lab time.

## Time Commitment
As per the guidelines for Eastern Washington University, for each credit hour spent in a lecture-discussion setting in the classroom, per week, requires 2-hours of outside preparation time. This is a 2 credit-hour class, and you can expect to put in up to 4-hours per week outside of the classroom on course exercises and projects.

## Presentation
Presentation is an essential skill to the success of a designer. You are expected to support, justify, and defend your design decisions. During critique, students should be able to verbalize the following:


1. How the work addresses the brief / assignment
2. How it is connected with their concept
3. The defined audience
4. The intent of the work

You will have your turn to present your work and address the points above. This is not the time to get defensive, but an opportunity to see your work from another perspective. Conversely, in formal critique, constructive criticism is expected. We are here to learn and grow as a community.

## Evaluation
The primary form of evaluation that this class will use are critiques. Presentation and critique participation is not optional.

It is only possible earn a maximum of 75/100 points for the due date listed in each respective project, with the opportunity to earn the remaining 25 points at the end of the quarter through iteration and revisions.

You'll receive feedback from your peers and the instructor. After feedback is received, you must provide the instructor with a brief write-up on what you plan on revising and how/why you arrived at that decision.

## Submission of Assignments / Projects
Assignments / Projects are due on or before the dates indicated in the class schedule. Late assignments will not be accepted without an excellent reason. A project is considered late if it is not ready at the beginning of a critique. If you foresee missing a critique/project due date, contact the instructor before that date for other possible arrangements. Inevitably problems arise during the completion of projects—production problems, hardware problems, software problems, schedule problems— please plan ahead, as most often these are not acceptable excuses for late projects.

## Final
During the final, industry professionals will come to campus to review your work. You will have a set amount of time with each professional. During this time, you will present your work and then receive feedback on the work presented. If you have not completed all of the course projects and assignments by the last day of regular classes, you will not be permitted to participate in the final. 

**Final Date is: 1–3pm on Wednesday, December 5th**
