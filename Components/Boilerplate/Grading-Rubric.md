# Grading Rubrics
Two scores will be awarded at separate times culminating into a single grade. The first score is 80% of the total grade. The second score is 20% of the total grade — for that project. 

For Example:
## Part I
* 80% of Total Grade
* _Process_ Score: 2 of 3 points
* _Product_ Score: 
	 - Content: 4 of 5 points
	- Design: 5 of 5 points
	- Production: 5 of 5 ponts  
* Grade for Part 1: 71% of 80% Max (16 of 18 points)
## Part II
* 20% of Total Grade
* _Launch_ Score: 3 of 3 points
* Grade for Part 2: 20% of 20% (3 of 3 points)
## Total Grade
* 71% (Part I) + 20% (Part II) = 91% Grade
