## Drop for Non-Attendance
Students are expected to attend all class sessions per Mode of Instruction as defined by the University. The course website, video tutorials, or peer note-taking is not a substitution for regular attendance. When a student misses more than 20% of the scheduled hours (5 classes or more) for a course, they may be withdrawn from the course and will receive the appropriate grade based on the Grading Policy.
