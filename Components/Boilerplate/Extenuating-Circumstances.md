## Extenuating Circumstances
Firstly, please understand we care about your situation greatly and recognize this is a challenging time for you. The welfare of all of our students comes first. 

Secondly, immediately speak with EWU Dean of Students Office (see below). We as Faculty are not in a position to make a determination on the severity of a situation. The Dean of Students can provide the best help, and options for you.  

Thirdly, grading is fair and consistent with all students per the syllabus provided. Without prior consent from the Dean of Students, we cannot make exceptions for extenuating circumstances.
