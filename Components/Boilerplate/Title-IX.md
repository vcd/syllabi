## Title IX
Eastern Washington University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. Sexual misconduct will NOT be tolerated at EWU. If you have been subjected to sexual misconduct, we encourage you to report this matter promptly.  As a faculty member, I am interested in promoting a safe and healthy environment, and should I learn of any sexual misconduct I must report the matter to the Title IX Coordinator.
