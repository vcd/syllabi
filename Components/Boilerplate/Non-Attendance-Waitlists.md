## Non-Attendance, Course Limits, & Waitlists
### Non-Attendance
Per EWU policy, students who do not attend at least one class session of an undergraduate course within the first five days of the term may be dropped from the course at the instructor’s discretion. Instructors must make any such drops by the end of the 6th day of the terms.

### VCD Courses
VCD courses are capped at 25 students. 

Due to the high demand of VCD courses, a first day no show-drop policy is in place beginning fall quarter 2017 for classes that have waitlists. If a student does not attend the first day of a course, they will be dropped from the course and the next person on the waitlist will be added. 

Most VCD courses are offered every quarter and some are offered twice a quarter. Students are encouraged to register early and work with their advisors to develop academic plans. If a student is on a waitlist they will be added to the course per EWU Academic Policy 303-30 and the information found on the Records and Registration website under the Waitlists tab. 

### Chapter 5 – Waitlists

5-1. General
If a course is closed and has a waitlist option, students may choose to be placed on the waitlist for that course section.

5-2. Waitlist Restrictions
a. Students shall not be waitlisted in more than one section per course. 
b. Students shall not register in both an open section and a waitlist section of the same course.

5-3. Student Responsibilities
Students are responsible for officially dropping or withdrawing from any course in which they have been waitlisted or enrolled and have subsequently decided not to take.

5-4. Administration
Waitlisted course credits are not included in billing statements or in calculations of credits needed for financial aid. No additional names will be added to a waitlist as of the end of the third day of the quarter. Students on the waitlist will either be dropped from the waitlist or added to the class by the fourth day of the quarter.

### From Records and Registration

Waitlists are established at the preference of the department. This is communicated to Records and Registration during the proofing process. The waitlist maximum on the course section can be increased or decreased from a default of 10 anytime during the open registration period via departmental written notification to Records and Registration.
Once a waitlist is established, no additional students can be enrolled in the course even if openings are available until the entire waitlist is cleared. Existing students on the waitlist will be enrolled automatically when an opening occurs in the course section.

If a faculty wishes to give a student permission to enroll in a closed (full) course section that has a waitlist, the faculty should wait until the 4th day of the quarter to sign the registration form giving permission for the enrollment. The waitlist will continue to run automatically through the end of the 3rd day of the quarter. No students can be added through faculty signature until the end of the waitlist process (the end of the 3rd day of the quarter).

### Getting off of the waitlist and officially registered in the course:

When a seat becomes available in a course you are waitlisted for, you will receive an email in your Eagles email account telling you that you will be registered for the course. If you have a registration hold on your record or registration into the course puts you in an overload status (over 18 quarter credits), Records and Registration will not be able to register you. 

Please contact Records and Registration, Sutton 201, 509.359.2321 immediately if you cannot confirm that you have been registered within 24 hours of receiving the email notification. Please check your Eagles email account frequently if you are on a course waitlist.  If you no longer wish to be enrolled in the course, you must drop yourself from the course on EagleNET or in person. You are responsible for tuition and fees for all courses you are registered for.
