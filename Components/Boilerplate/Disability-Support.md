## Disability Support Services (DSS)

Your experience in this class is important to me. If you already have an accommodation plan through Disability Support Services (DSS), please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to use your approved accommodations in this class. If you do not have an accommodation plan, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that may require an accommodation, please contact DSS at dss@ewu.edu or 509-359-6871. You can also visit their website at: https://inside.ewu.edu/dss/.

If you have not yet established services through DSS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DSS at 509-359-6871, 121 Tawanka, [dss@ewu.edu][1]. 

If you would like to request an accommodation for reasons of faith or conscience, please refer to EWUâ€™s policy on Holidays and Religious Accommodations available at: https://inside.ewu.edu/policies/. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Holidays and Religious Accommodations Request available at: https://inside.ewu.edu/student-life/resources/holidays-and-religious-accommodations-request/.  

DSS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s) and DSS. It is the policy and practice of the Eastern Washington University to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.
