## Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

Violations of academic integrity involve the use of any method or technique enabling a student to misrepresent the quality and integrity of his or her own academic work or the work of a fellow student. Students committing academic dishonesty will be reported to the appropriate university officials and the appropriate sanction up to recording an X grade for this course on the student’s transcript. In cases where a student has an existing record of academic dishonesty, a more severe penalty may be applied, such as suspension or dismissal from the university. For further information, please refer to the Student Academic Integrity Policy posted on the Eastern Washington University web site.

Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam, paper or project; failure in course; and or expulsion from the University. For more information refer to “Academic Integrity Policy” in the EWU Graduate &amp; Undergraduate Catalog.
