# InVision Student Account

## From InVision: 

* Please have your students sign-up here using their school email address: http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup
* The code is: **56-73-13-19**
* It's just that simple! This is for new accounts. If a student already has an account, just have them email me with their expected graduation date. I will make sure they get their upgrade.

## Benefits of Student Accounts

* UNLIMITED Prototypes & Boards as always! : As we announced last year, students can now have UNLIMITED prototypes in their account, rather than just 3. This will help students more easily complete their course work. It also allows them to use InVision for their own projects. 
* Pre-recorded Video Demo : We offer a pre-recorded version of our introductory demo. This will help you and your students get up and running fast with InVision. If you are interested in this, just respond to this email, and let me know.
