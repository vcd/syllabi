## Description
Students examine different rhetorical frameworks that inform software user interface/experience (UI/UE) and content design. Supporting theories, such as visual rhetoric, contextual design, information architecture, gestalt, content strategy, and design ethics, are investigated. Students demonstrate their understanding of theoretical principles by creating and redesigning small UI-related deliverables and by practicing rigorous written analysis and critique.
